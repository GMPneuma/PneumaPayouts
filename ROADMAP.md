# Pneuma's Payouts Roadmap

## Goal

Give a GM one window for selecting session participants, distributing Cyberpunk
RED rewards, and retaining a useful record of each payout.

## Recommended execution order

The order below accounts for both difficulty and dependencies. A later item may
be mechanically easy but appears later because it relies on the shared payout
and persistence layers.

Status key: `[x]` complete, `[~]` usable but incomplete, `[ ]` not implemented,
`[-]` intentionally not planned.

### Milestone 1: Foundation

- [x] **1. Define payout records and module storage** — Easy
  - Establish one data shape for a payout event.
  - Record timestamp, GM, session label, notes, selected players/Actors, and all
    applied changes.
  - Decide which data belongs in world settings, Actor flags, or a journal.
- [x] **2. Discover player accounts and associated Actors** — Easy
  - Read non-GM users, their assigned Actor, and all owned character Actors.
  - Handle players with no assigned Actor and Actors shared by multiple users.
  - Present active/inactive status without excluding offline players.
- [x] **3. Build the GM payout window and participant selector** — Easy–Medium
  - Open from an appropriate Foundry control or settings button.
  - Select attendees and default sensibly from active users.
  - Restrict payout execution to GMs.
- [x] **4. Add validation, preview, and transactional execution** — Medium
  - Show exactly what will change before applying a payout.
  - Reject invalid amounts and missing/unsupported Actors.
  - Avoid partial payouts when an update fails.
  - Prevent accidental double submission.

### Milestone 2: Core character payouts

- [x] **5. Primary Money and IP payouts** — Medium
  - Give every selected character the same Money and/or IP adjustment.
  - Support positive, zero, and intentionally negative adjustments where valid.
- [x] **6. Primary Humanity Gain and Humanity Loss** — Medium
  - Expose gain and loss as clear, separate inputs.
  - Apply the Cyberpunk RED system's Humanity rules and limits correctly.
- [x] **7. Additional individual payouts in the same window** — Medium–Hard
  - Add per-character overrides or bonuses alongside group values.
  - Support Money, IP, Humanity Gain, Humanity Loss, and Reputation.
  - Preview the combined group and individual result for each character.
- [x] **8. Standard Reputation payouts** — Medium
  - Apply character Reputation changes through the individual payout section.
  - Include the old value, adjustment, and new value in the payout record.

### Milestone 3: Shared and persistent rewards

- [x] **9. Communal Money payout to a Container Actor** — Medium
  - Configure a Default Payout Container in module settings without
    automatically creating an Actor.
  - Override the Payout Container for an individual payout.
  - Require a valid Cyberpunk RED Container Actor when Communal Money or Items
    are present.
  - Apply and record Communal Money with Preview, Discord, ledger, Payout Log,
    and transactional rollback support.
- [x] **10. Attendance and sessions-played tally** — Medium–Hard
  - Derive attendance from the selected payout participants.
  - Maintain an ongoing per-player sessions-played total.
  - Record the most recent session name for each player.
  - Store attendance by Foundry player account rather than Actor.
- [x] **11. HQ IP pool** — Medium–Hard
  - Maintain HQ IP at the world/group level instead of on a character.
  - Record gains from Communal Payouts in the editable HQ journal.
  - Allow GM-entered negative spending adjustments.
  - Display a recalculated Current HQ IP total on the HQ journal page.
  - Manual journal rows remain the intended spending workflow because HQ IP
    spending is infrequent.
- [x] **12. Faction-specific Reputation journal** — Hard
  - Track faction Reputation separately from normal Actor Reputation.
  - Write structured Actor, Reputation, Faction, and Reason rows to the Payouts
    journal.
  - Replace the current value when the same Actor and faction receive another
    Specific Reputation payout.
  - Factions intentionally remain free-text because a campaign may use dozens
    or hundreds of them; managed faction definitions are not planned.

### Milestone 4: Completion and safety

- [x] **13. Payout history log** — Medium
  - Every completed payout receives a permanent page in the GM-only Payout Log
    journal.
  - The internal versioned payout ledger retains structured records.
  - The journal is intentionally a reference-only log; a separate history
    browser, filtering UI, and payout-history editor are not required.
- [-] **14. Automated Foundry integration tests** — Hard
  - Stored payout records are versioned and legacy journal markup has targeted
    migration handling.
  - Type checking, production builds, formatting, and package validation remain
    part of the release process.
  - A containerized Foundry v12 browser-test environment is intentionally not
    planned because it would require maintaining a licensed Foundry installation,
    Docker, and test-world data outside the normal hosted game environment.

### Milestone 5: Player communication and external summaries

- [x] **15. Persistent player Payout Inbox** — Medium
  - Show each player all Primary and individual rewards that apply to them.
  - Track acknowledgment separately for each payout and remove acknowledged
    items from the active Inbox.
  - Keep multiple Humanity rolls independently identifiable and actionable.
  - Allow GMs to review pending actions while requiring an explicit opt-in
    before rolling or acknowledging on a player's behalf.
- [x] **16. Player-controlled Humanity rolls** — Medium–Hard
  - Create targeted chat prompts and persistent Inbox actions for fixed payout
    roll formulas from 1d6 through 4d6.
  - Apply the result to Humanity and EMP exactly once.
- [x] **17. Discord-compatible payout summary** — Medium
  - Put Communal and Primary awards first and individual rewards afterward.
  - Support Discord User IDs, per-player Role IDs, and a whole-crew Role ID.
  - Allow the Discord output dialog to be disabled in module settings.
- [x] **18. Self-maintaining Foundry journals** — Medium
  - Create module-owned Payouts and Payout Log journals without adopting
    unrelated journals that share those names.
  - Give GMs ownership of both journals, players read-only access to Payouts,
    and no player access to Payout Log.

### Milestone 6: Inventory payouts

- [x] **19. Item document payouts** — Medium–Hard
  - Accept any Foundry Item document in Communal and individual payouts only,
    including compendium, world-directory, custom, and embedded Items.
  - Deliver individual Items to the selected Actor with transactional rollback.
    Stackable Cyberpunk RED Items use one correctly sized `system.amount` stack;
    non-stackable Items use separate copies when quantity is greater than one.
  - Include item names, quantities, descriptions, and source UUIDs in
    Preview, Inbox, Discord output, the structured ledger, and Payout Log.
  - Deliver Communal Items to the selected Payout Container.
  - New stacks remain distinct rather than merging into matching owned Items.
    Additional exhaustive Item-type edge-case testing is not planned.
- [x] **20. Display-only Primary Downtime payouts** — Easy
  - Keep Downtime visible alongside Primary Money and IP with a day count and
    description.
  - Include Downtime in Preview, recipient acknowledgments, Discord Markdown,
    the structured ledger, and Payout Log without modifying Actors or the
    Payouts journal.

## Current release state

Version `0.9.0` provides the complete intended payout workflow: character and
communal rewards, attendance, HQ IP, faction Reputation, Item delivery, player
acknowledgment and Humanity rolls, Discord summaries, and audit journals.
Correction/reversal workflows, managed faction definitions, exhaustive Item
edge-case testing, and containerized Foundry integration tests are intentionally
out of scope for this friendly-game module.

## Next recommended work

1. Continue native-looking UI refinement for the Payout and Payout Inbox forms.
2. Address defects found during normal campaign use.
3. Revisit Foundry compatibility when Cyberpunk RED supports a newer core
   version.

## Decisions to make while implementing

- Whether negative Money/IP values are permitted or must use a separate spending
  workflow.
- Whether future Foundry versions provide useful native calendar integration.

## Resolved design decisions

- Each selected player can have only one Actor in a payout; shared Actor IDs are
  deduplicated.
- Attendance is keyed by Foundry player account, not Actor.
- Session Name is required; In-Game Date and Notes are retained with the payout.
- The most recently entered In-Game Date becomes the next payout's default.
- Humanity dice are rolled by the owning player rather than by the GM by default.
- Module journals are identified by stored IDs and are never adopted by name.
- HQ spending remains a manually entered journal adjustment.
- Factions remain free-text and payout corrections are handled pragmatically by
  the GM rather than through a dedicated reversal workflow.
- A local/containerized Foundry integration-test environment is not maintained.
- Foundry v12 remains the supported target while Cyberpunk RED requires it. A
  future v13 migration may use Foundry's world calendar APIs when available; the
  module will not build a custom calendar UI.
